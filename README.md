## Doodle Challenge

> Dražen Buljovčić

This is a coding assesment challenge sent to me to implement a small app based on the [assignment](https://github.com/DoodleScheduling/hiring-challenges/tree/master/frontend-engineer).

### App

This is a [Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) that utilizes SSR to present all components to the user immediately on page load.

> SSR can be previewed directly on the Vercel dashboard.

The app is deployed and is accessible [here](https://doodle-challenge-drazenbuljovcic.vercel.app/chat)!

### Workflow

Please check [package.json](package.json) for all available scripts to manage the application development.

Run in your terminal and the app will open by default on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```
$ yarn dev
```

_Change port number if the default one already has a process running_
